# This plugin will grab the current selection, or the word under the cursor, and automatically pre-fill the Goto Anything
# overlay with the given text.  For example, highlighting a class name and then invoking this plugin will open the 
# Goto Anything overlay and pre-fill it with the class name, which for my usage makes navigating my projects much easier.
# Default keybinding is ctrl + ;

        # If you wish, you can enable the use of custom word separators.  Sublime Text will use these
        # to determine where a "word" begins and ends.  The values for these are set in the default settings,
        # or in the user settings if you've overridden them already.  Enabling this option will NOT
        # permanently change your settings.  It will save your current settings, change them temporarily,
        # and then write them back out.  Some may find it useful to change the word separator to be simply a space,
        # in which case this plugin will grab the current string until it reaches whitespace.  Note that enabling this 
        # option may lead to some extraneous output in your console as the settings file is saved .
        # (Sublime Text automatically re-parses the settings file if it detects that it has been modified.)

        # To enable this functionality, change the value of 'overrideWordSeparators' to 'true'

        # The characters that you wish to identify as a word separators should be entered inside the quotation marks, one 
        # after another, with nothing in between them.  Special characters must be escaped.  For example:

        customWordSeparators = " "
